# Snake Game 2018
This game was built for the module "Games Programming" whilst studying at the University of Lincoln. We had to use SDL2, and build our own engine and then utilize it by building a game. Due to the rushed development, this isn't really a properly developed engine. It has lots of flaws and issues which I aim to fix in due course. 

### Features

- A basic level limited to sixty seconds.
