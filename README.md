# Snake Game 2018
This game was built for the module "Games Programming" whilst studying at the University of Lincoln. The goal was to build our own game engine by utilizing SDL 2, and then building a game ontop of the engine. Due to the rushed development, this isn't really a properly developed engine. It has lots of flaws and issues which I aim to fix in due course. 

### Features
- Ability to use a gamepad and mouse + keyboard simultaneously.
- A basic level limited to sixty seconds.
